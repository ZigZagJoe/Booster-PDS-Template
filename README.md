# Macintosh 68030 PDS Template

This is a basic schematic and board layout for a card intended for use in a Macintosh SE/30 or IIsi PDS slot. It is based on a replica of the Interware Booster 50-SE30F board.

It is ideal for use in the IIsi and allows a second card to be used with a straight EuroDIN connector installed in CN2.

It may also be used in a SE/30 and allows stacking cards vertically. However, as it is a nonstandard formfactor, the chassis tabs will need to be carefully bent away and insulated from any second card installed.
